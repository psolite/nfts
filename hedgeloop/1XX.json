    "description": "Legends spoke of these heroes being summoned only by those worthy, their strength tied to the holder’s will. With every NFT minted, a Poppet Hero was born some wielding shields of gold, others controlling elements of fire or ice. As collectors gathered these digital warriors, battles raged across the metaverse, and alliances were forged.",
